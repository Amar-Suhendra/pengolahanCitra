    """
    Edge detection is a fundamental technique in image processing used to identify boundaries within an image. It plays a crucial role in various computer vision tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, and more. The primary goal of edge detection is to find the regions in an image where pixel intensities change rapidly, ypically indicating the presence of object boundaries or edges.

    """
    Edge detection algorithms, such as the Canny edge detector, Sobel, and Laplacian, analyze the gradient or the rate of change in pixel intensities across an image. These algorithms apply convolution operations to highlight areas with significant changes in intensity, making it easier to identify edges."""
