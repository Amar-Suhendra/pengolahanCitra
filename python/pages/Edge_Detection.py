    "Edge detection is a fundamental technique in image processing used to identify boundaries within an image. It plays a crucial role in various computer vision tasks, "
    "including object detection, image segmentation, and more. The primary goal of edge detection is to find the regions in an image where pixel intensities change rapidly, "
    "typically indicating the presence of object boundaries or edges."

st.write("## How it works?")

st.write(
    "Edge detection algorithms, such as the Canny edge detector, Sobel, and Laplacian, analyze the gradient or the rate of change in pixel intensities across an image. "
    "These algorithms apply convolution operations to highlight areas with significant changes in intensity, making it easier to identify edges."
