  """
  Histogram Equalization is a computer image processing technique used to improve contrast in images. It accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values, i.e. stretching out the intensity range of the image.

  """
  Histogram equalization enhances image contrast by adjusting pixel intensities to create a more balanced histogram, improving detail visibility, particularly in images with poor initial contrast. It's a valuable technique in image processing, though it may require careful application, especially in color images where channels are processed independently.
